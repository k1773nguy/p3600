I feel like I should mention that I have nothing against "little people",
and treat them just like anyone else.
(within reason: I wouldn't ask someone who is 3 feet tall to get something
off the top of the refrigerator, for example.)
It's just that there are so many opportunities for humor when dwarves
are involved.

In other words: no offense.

Also, "little people" seems condescending.
