It's a game.


Running
-------

The engine was originally going to be written from scratch, but then I
found [LÖVE](https://love2d.org).

Since LÖVE is exactly what the original engine was going to be, but in
C++, it is used instead of reinventing the wheel.


Building
--------

Run `./submodules.sh`, `./build.sh`.

The makefile is written so that `make -j` is safe.
